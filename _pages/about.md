My name is Hunter Coffman and I am currently a part of the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Specifically, I'm currently a graduate student pursuing my Master's degree in the field of Computer Engineering.

Academics
======
I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz in June 2019 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Computer Engineering. I have recently returned to the university to pursue an even higher education and gain further insight into the regions of academia I love to study.

My particular research interests lie in the domain of Computer Architecture, improving Hardware Design flow, and emerging hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Chisel and Pyrope. I'm a member of the [MASC](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/) (Micro-Architecture Santa Cruz) research group. Currently, our main focus is on making our own HDL called [Pyrope](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/pyrope.html#1) and also by making the hardware design flow much more efficient through our project LiveHD. My specific contribution to [LiveHD](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd) is currently through creating a bitwidth inference/optimization pass and eventually I also plan on allowing LiveHD to interface between FIRRTL (research from UC Berkeley) and our software tool.

Work Experience
======
From June 2019 to September 2019 I worked as an intern for SiFive's Verification Engineering team, specifically focusing on Core Verification. I added new test infrastructure using the Verilog DPI interface to make calls out to C functions that controled signals internal to the core. I also worked on verifying the core's interaction with a newly designed memory protection component for a very large customer. There I gained experience in verification methodology, writing Chisel code, applying academic concepts to real-life solutions (cache coherency protocols), and working in a high-intensity (but also high fun!) work environment.

For those who may not know, SiFive is a company that was made in making RISC-V CoreIP. A lot of the original designers of RISC-V work for the company. Go SiFive!
