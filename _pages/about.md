My name is Hunter Coffman and I am a part of Apple's design verification team. I am an alumni from the University of California, Santa Cruz where I obtained my Master's of Science in Computer Engineering in September 2020. I also obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, Minor in Computer Engineering from the same institution in June 2019.

Academics
======
My particular research interests lie in the domain of computer architecture, improving hardware design flows, and emerging hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Chisel and Pyrope. I'm an alumni of the [MASC](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/) (Micro-Architecture Santa Cruz) research group. While I was a member, our main focus was on making our own HDL called [Pyrope](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/pyrope.html#1) and also making the hardware design flow much more efficient through our project LiveHD. My specific contribution to [LiveHD](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd) is currently through creating a bitwidth inference/optimization pass and also a Chisel/FIRRTL interface with the framework. More on my contributions can be found in [my thesis](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5n78t1nc).

Work Experience
======
Here is a summary of my work experience. For a more detailed history, go to the Resume page found at the top of this site.

From June 2019 to September 2019 I worked as an intern for SiFive's Verification Engineering team, specifically focusing on Core Verification. I added new test infrastructure using the Verilog DPI interface to make calls out to C functions that controled signals internal to the core. I also worked on verifying the core's interaction with a newly designed memory protection component for a very large customer. There I gained experience in verification methodology, writing Chisel code, applying academic concepts to real-life solutions (cache coherency protocols), and working in a high-intensity (but also high fun!) work environment.

For those who may not know, SiFive is a company that was made in making RISC-V CoreIP. A lot of the original designers of RISC-V work for the company. Go SiFive!

Since September 2020, I've been a member of Apple's design verification team. Here, I've been working on verifying block-level components of our designs using UVM.
